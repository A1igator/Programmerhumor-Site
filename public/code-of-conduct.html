    <h1>The ProgrammerHumor Code of Conduct</h1>
    <p>All delegates, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at any ProgrammerHumor 
event are required to agree with the following code of conduct. 
Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.</p>
    <h2>The Quick Version</h2>
    <p>ProgrammerHumor is dedicated to providing a harassment-free Hackathon 
experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and 
expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, 
body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology 
choices. We do not tolerate harassment of Hackathon participants in any
 form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any Hackathon
 venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online 
media. Hackathon participants violating these rules may be sanctioned 
or expelled from the Hackathon without a refund at the discretion of 
the Hackathon organisers.</p>
    <h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>
    <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, 
gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, 
physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology 
choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, 
stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained 
disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and
 unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
    <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
    <p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In 
particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or 
other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use 
sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized 
environment.</p>
    <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the Hackathon 
organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning 
the offender or expulsion from the Hackathon with no refund.</p>
    <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being 
harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of 
Hackathon staff immediately. Hackathon staff can be identified by a 
clearly marked "STAFF" shirt.</p>
    <p>Hackathon staff will be happy to help participants contact 
hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or 
otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the 
duration of the Hackathon. We value your attendance.</p>
    <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all Hackathon channels and Hackathon-related social events.</p>
    <h2>The Ethical Suggestions</h2>
    <p>You must follow everything above, but everything below is mearly a suggestion. We have borrowed the idea off of the <a href="https://sqlite.org/codeofethics.html">sqlite code of ethics</a>, and 
      we believe that anyone who follows everything below will live a happier and more productive life, but individuals are free to dispute or ignore that advice if they wish.
